# Web Application
The web app was developed in Flask, a web development framework in python that can easily bridge the gap between our GPT2-model and the front-end which was based on the template in [this project](https://github.com/huzaifsayed/coronabot-chatterbot), developed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
