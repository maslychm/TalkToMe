Mykola: So game theory = dynamic game theory? <|endoftext|>  Steven: no I think there are cases where the system is static <|endoftext|> 
Mykola: How is it dynamic? <|endoftext|>  Steven: because the system is always evolving over time especially in unexpected scenarios <|endoftext|> 
Mykola: It's fine Did you start searching for a topic for your thesis? <|endoftext|>  Steven: we're thinking about Dynamic Game Theory applied to multi-agent systems, specifically autonomous vehicles but I'm still researching the topic sounds very interesting tbh <|endoftext|>

I went yesterday to the rover robotics club. NASA has a competition every year where they simulate a moon environemnt and you have to build a robot that navigates. L meeting ken about ROS  very familiar <|endoftext|> 
Mykola: I wish we have them here. I want to buy 50 1$ black shirts and get on with my life <|endoftext|>  Steven: we explored orlando. Ro7t 3a Icon Park, which is the cheap version of Universal (Universal is too expensive for me rn). Ro7na top golf which is like a mini-golf thing. WE went bowling, electric-scootered downtown Orlando, biked through International Drive, saw a frickin rocket launch. omg. I bought 10 of these. their quality is super bad <|endoftext|>

Mykola: I have issues too I know Last thing he said that he'll talk to us in a meeting He kept us waiting for 1h30 min We sent him an email to which he replied that they are forming a sheet of the tasks that should be done But wait a min Why did they not include us??? WE are the one yale badon yenlaza2o haida l project Now I'm super uncomfortable <|endoftext|>  Steven: include you wen? <|endoftext|> 
Mykola: Not my problem <|endoftext|>  Steven: true bas it's such a mess he put you in <|endoftext|> 
Mykola: Hue b kaza team. And he's going to France on the 27th so ig ndaghat bl deadlines. Bas he has no right to behave this way He literally spent days working with us and now he can't even send a simple text telling us he doesn't want to continue on this He even told the one responsible for contacting the client and this one talked to us (me and the girl) in a kind of rude tone. But I didn't let him intimidate me <|endoftext|>  Steven: barke he's having some personal issues <|endoftext|> 
Mykola: The whole thing was manifested by the boy And now he's doesn't want to spend time on it <|endoftext|>  Steven: you have no obligation to feel sorry for your other coworker even though you want it. You told him you don't want this and your coworker didn't mind taking the project. Fa she should have said something kamen bas l fekra hiyye haydak l coworker lesh 8ayyar faj2a? iza by3rf keef yzabbeta w 3amel 7alo sh8le kbeere <|endoftext|> 
Mykola: Bad Cz she's lost like me <|endoftext|>  Steven: you clearly told him I don't work in this <|endoftext|> 
Mykola: He's understanding and did not change with me which is fine He said that I will help but I will mot be the main person on it But It landed on my other co-worker's shoulders <|endoftext|>  Steven: is that a good thing or a bad thing? <|endoftext|> 
Mykola: I talked to him today The co-worker that I told you about contacted him Keep in mind that I was clear with  my boss before signing the contract that I am no specialist in this kind of work And tbh I don't want to be cz it's not the career path that I want <|endoftext|>  Steven: what did he say tho? <|endoftext|> 
Mykola: If you see the code you'll have a seizure <|endoftext|>  Steven: Don't you have to do this now if they require it? Can you do anything about it? I think email your boss (whoever that is) and tell him about this. I think he would know what to do. <|endoftext|> 
Mykola: We are only 3 employees in this team It's an application for a client It has several features One of them is a chatapp It takes messages from what'sapp through twilio then puts them in a sql database and is hosted on azure It uses sockets for communication. The problem is that the sockets are not working correctly as they are omitting some messages, and you have to refresh the page to get the ones that weren't shown This problem was from 5 months ago. A team outside my company worked on it and it didn't work. We worked on debugging but it is still the same Now they want to create the sockets from scratch which is hard because we still have to abide by their original code cz it's part of a whole application <|endoftext|>  Steven: the project sounds so cool btw bas. <|endoftext|> 
Mykola: I have already 2 other projects but I don't mind getting another one But they're adamant on pursuing this one <|endoftext|>  Steven: what's it about? <|endoftext|> 
Mykola: There is a project that is a mess. I told them I reached a dead end each time. They kept insisting on doing it because a colleague of mine said he can. Now this colleague has other projects and he doesn't want to work on it And it's not in my specialty Now idk what's gonna happen I'm more annoyed with my colleague because he was very friendly. Suddenly today he stopped staying in meetings with my other colleague and kept contacting the higher ups to deal with the project At least he could be upfront about it and say I'm busy I can't work on it anymore ... <|endoftext|>  Steven: sorry! I went to the restroom! I think max they'll assign u another project, no? Or do you have to do this one? <|endoftext|> 
Mykola: Nehna we just downloaded it as dependency Very bad Work got messy <|endoftext|>  Steven: what happened? :/ <|endoftext|> 
Mykola: Ok good I still have my neurons <|endoftext|>  Steven:   how was your day? <|endoftext|> 
Mykola: Did we use it? I can't remember <|endoftext|>  Steven: bil lane detection, i used it ana w zahraa <|endoftext|> 
Mykola: Oh Do they at least teach you ways to do it? Or like aub they teach you poetry and ask you to build a spaceship? <|endoftext|>  Steven: they just teach us theory. Ur on ur own from there bas luckily, we have some experience bi OpenCV bcz of FYP *Naseem Smiles with Pride* <|endoftext|> 
Mykola: After a bit How are you today? <|endoftext|>  Steven: been in the lab all day  bil computer vision, they want us to implement the canny filter from scratch and use only 1D gaussian kernels :/ bas it's fun <|endoftext|> 
Mykola: okkk good luck!! <|endoftext|>  Steven: thx              i'll take it <|endoftext|>

Apply to different universities in Canada and see what happens my cousin graduated from BAU and he is now doing his masters in Concordia in Montreal. They will get you a guaranteed acceptance. they do take a lot of money but I think it's worth it <|endoftext|> 
Mykola: if you take the people that you care about and go to the us, why will you come back again? it's cold the way the people here are treating us <|endoftext|>  Steven: visit the country you were born in promise me you will get out. I know you want to, but promise me you will. I never thought I would be saying leaving the country and never coming back, bas b3d li shefto hon w keef l nes 3ayshe, ma hamema shi bil marra, 3njd you start to question how Lebanon is country  <|endoftext|> 
Mykola: this is really nice a country that is not broke maybe I'll travel in the future but surely not this year yup we know that allah b 3in enta you're meaning to stay and get the green card? and khalas be a us citizen? <|endoftext|>  Steven: I wanna do what my advisor.

Mykola: what happened with imad's research? <|endoftext|>  Steven: some new guy is working on it. We met once and told him everything we did over the year. Bas he doesn't even know ROS so it's gonna be a while until he figures out how the system works and all that. by the time he figures it out, mnktob l paper which will take a lot of time. la2n baddo yet3allam ROS w AWS w 100 ossa <|endoftext|>
